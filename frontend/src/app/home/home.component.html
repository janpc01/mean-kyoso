  <h2 class="faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  
  <div class="faq-grid">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">What is included in the collector card pack?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">Each KyosoCards pack is thoughtfully designed to include a custom collector card that you create, accompanied by 19 other cards that represent the Canadian judo community. A bonus feature in each pack is the KyosoCards Shiai playing card game.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">How does the royalty system work?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">When you create your custom collector card, it automatically becomes a part of the year's ongoing series. As such, your card may be randomly featured in future card packs. Each time your card gets printed, your royalty account gets credited with $0.10.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">How does my KyosoCards purchase help with fundraising for my Judo Club?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">For every collector card from your Judo Club included in a pack, a $0.05 donation is earmarked annually towards your club. More club members participating in the KyosoCards community amplifies your club's fundraising potential.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">Why is it not possible to order individual collector cards?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">A key element of the KysoCards mission is to bring together the judo community. To further this cause, collector cards are exclusively sold as a part of the comprehensive pack, enriching the collective experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">Is there a way for family and friends to buy a pack with specific judoka?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">Absolutely. By leveraging the search function on the KyosoCards website, you can customize a collector card pack featuring a specific judoka, like your grandson or granddaughter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">How does the KyosoCards playing card game work?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">The Shiai card game lets you engage in friendly competition, using your collector cards against a friend's. Choose to either play "for keeps," staking your card, or instead play just "for fun."</p>
      <p class="faq-ans">Check out the <a routerLink="/game-rules">Playing Card Game Rules</a> for more details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">What strategies can I adopt to increase my royalties and maximize my club's fundraising?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">Our platform utilizes a random draw mechanism from the year's ongoing collection, excluding the National Team roster. The earlier you design your card within the year, the higher the probability of it being featured in the packs ordered. Delayed creation might result in fewer opportunities for your card to be printed and potentially lower royalties as the year progresses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">Can I create multiple cards per year?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">Certainly. KyosoCards encourages judokas to commemorate their unique judo journey. This could be celebrating an achievement like a grading or a tournament win, immortalizing a picture of a judo technique, or simply creating a personalized keepsake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">Why is there a delay in shipping packs at the onset of a new season?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">We ensure a minimum collection of 50 cards before initiating the print and shipping process for the first pack of a new series. This guarantees a variety of cards in your collection. Although early ordering might result in a brief shipping delay, it significantly enhances your chances of earning royalty rewards.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2 class="faq-qus">Can I choose the judo waza (technique) on the back of my custom collector card?</h2>
      <p class="faq-ans">Currently, this feature is unavailable. The images on the reverse side are randomly chosen from our Go-Kyo-No-Waza collection. We encourage you to accumulate a complete set of KyosoCards as a fun way to teach new judokas about the Go-Kyo and familiarize them with all 40 throws.</p>
